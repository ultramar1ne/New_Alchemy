    "In this problem set, we will revisit the same movie review data from last time.  We will first try to predict the numeric score of the review (regression) using ridge regression (problems 1 and 2).  Then, we will try to just predict whether it is a good review or bad review (problems 3 and 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below imports all allowed libraries and loads the data.  The variables loaded are as follows\n",
    "- Training data:\n",
    "    - `trainX` the data matrix, as is standard.  Each feature is a little different from last time.  The ith feature corresponds to the ith most common word across all reviews.  It is still related to the number of times the word is used in the review.  However, this time instead of bucketing this number into a category, we use the real value. Except, that instead of the raw count, we record the number of standard deviations this raw count is away from the mean raw count.  Why?  Well, we will cover that in week 9 or 10.  However, this makes things work better.  So, if the value is 0, then this review uses this word the average number of times.  If the value is +1, this review uses this word one standard deviation higher than average.  If -1, it uses it one standard deviation less than average.\n",
    "    - `trainYreg` the regression prediciton values.  We don't predict the raw rating (from 0 to 10), but rather the difference of this raw rating and 5.  So if the value in this vector is +3, that means the rating was an 8.  If the value is -4, the actual rating was a 1.\n",
    "    - `trainYclass` the classification prediction values.  These are +1 for positive reviews and -1 for negative reviews, same as last time.\n",
    "- Testing data:\n",
    "    - `testX` same as `trainX` but for the testing set\n",
    "    - `testYreg` same as `trainYreg` but for the training set\n",
    "    - `testYclass` same as `trainYclass` but for the training set\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that the X matrices have the \"column of all ones\" (or the constant feature) already added as the zeroth column."
