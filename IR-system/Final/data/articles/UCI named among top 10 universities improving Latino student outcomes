<article> UCI is a leader in closing the graduation gap between Latino and white students, according to the latest report from The Education Trust, a nonprofit advocacy organization. Based on three-year averages of federal data (2013 to 2015), the report computes and compares graduation rates and completion gaps between Latino and white students at four-year public and private nonprofit colleges and universities. With a graduation gap of only 3 percentage points, UCI is identified as one of the 10 top-performing institutions, with  an 81.1 percent Latino student graduation rate, compared to an 84.1 percent rate for white students. Nationally, the college graduation rate for Latino students is 10 percentage points behind the rate for their white counterparts – 53.6 percent and 63.3 percent, respectively. “As we have learned what is contributing to Latino student success at UCI,” said Wil Del Pilar, vice president of higher education policy and practice at The Education Trust, “we are encouraged not only by what you have accomplished, but also by your commitment to continue to take responsibility for the success of all students.” </article>
