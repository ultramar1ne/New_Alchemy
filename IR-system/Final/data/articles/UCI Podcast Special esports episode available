<article> A new episode of the UCI Podcast is available for listening. The guests are Mark Deppe, director of UCI Esports, and Avi Behar, a player on UCI’s five-member League of Legends team. The Anteaters are preparing to defend their title as national collegiate LoL champions in a tournament starting Friday, May 24, at Riot Games’ LCS Arena in Los Angeles. Behar talks about his role on the squad and how he came to be a scholarship-supported player on one of the world’s best LoL teams. Deppe discusses the history and culture of UCI Esports, which is widely recognized as a model university esports program. This episode is the first of a two-part podcast special on esports. In the next, we will share conversations with two UCI faculty members who are leaders in the academic study of esports and video games in general.
