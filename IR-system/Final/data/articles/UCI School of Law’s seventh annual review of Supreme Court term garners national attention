<article> The School of Law’s seventh annual Supreme Court Term in Review earlier this month featured an all-star panel of judges, scholars and journalists, whose lively discussion of key Supreme Court cases decided in the October 2016 term attracted hundreds of people to the Irvine Barclay Theatre and thousands more who tuned in via livestream. Prominent Supreme Court watchers took notice of the event and continued the debates in The Washington Post, the Washington Examiner and other national media outlets. Participants addressed the national travel ban, the role of the judiciary, and how the new Supreme Court justice might vote on controversial issues, among other topics. They also previewed the October 2017 term and took questions from the audience and online viewers. The stellar panel was moderated by Rick Hasen, UCI Chancellor’s Professor of law and political science, and included Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and founding dean of UCI’s law school; Alex Kozinski, a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Leondra Kruger, an associate justice of the California Supreme Court; Leah Litman, UCI assistant professor of law; and Greg Stohr, a Supreme Court reporter for Bloomberg News. A recap of the event – featuring video, photos, news articles and tweets – is available here. </article>
