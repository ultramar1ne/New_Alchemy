<article> Karen Lawrence, UCI professor emerita of English and former dean of the School of Humanities (1998-2007), has been named president of The Huntington Library, Art Collections & Botanical Gardens in San Marino, effective Sept. 1. “We are thrilled that Karen has received this appointment,” said Tyrus Miller, current dean of the School of Humanities. “Her legacy at UCI speaks to her unwavering advocacy on behalf of the humanities, and we look forward to exploring partnership ideas that pair The Huntington’s rich historical resources with our faculty and student scholars.” During her tenure as dean, Lawrence established two centers: the International Center for Writing & Translation, for which she hired world-renowned writer Ngugi wa Thiong’o as founding director; and the Samuel Jordan Center for Persian Studies & Culture.
