<article> Robin Keller, professor of operations and decision technologies in UCI’s Paul Merage School of Business, is co-author of a paper that received the 2020 Decision Analysis Special Recognition Award from the Decision Analysis journal. The winning entry describes her team’s study of human mortality risks and monetary outcomes. Many projects or environmental regulation policies involve risks to life, such as toxic exposures, that are experienced over time. The researchers investigated the preferences of individuals regarding lives lost or saved over time to better understand how to implement more effective policies. Keller’s co-authors, both from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, are Jeffery L. Guyse, professor of technology and operations management, and Candice H. Huynh, associate professor of technology and operations management. </article>
