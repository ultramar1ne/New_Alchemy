<article> Campus Recreation has partnered with Special Olympics Southern California to train Special Olympics athletes in flag football. The first clinic took place Dec. 2 on Anteater Recreation Center fields. Campus Recreation officials hope this will be an ongoing partnership, with the ultimate goal of starting a Unified Sports flag football league, in which students can participate alongside Special Olympics athletes. “We are thrilled to work with an organization that believes in the inclusive ideals of sports and strives to serve all those with a desire to play,” said Andy Christopher, director of UCI intramural sports. “Special Olympics Southern California reinforces our department’s belief that sports can provide positive opportunities to people of all abilities.” </article>
