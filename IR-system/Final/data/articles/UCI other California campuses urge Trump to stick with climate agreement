<article> UCI faculty are joining thousands of colleagues across California in signing an open letter on climate change to President Donald Trump and his administration, calling on them “in the most urgent terms possible, to maintain our country’s commitment to meeting the greenhouse gas emission targets set forth in the Paris Climate Agreement.” The U.S. signed the pact last year, along with 193 other nations, and it went into effect in November. Trump and some cabinet appointees have expressed skepticism that human activity plays a role in rising global temperatures. “It’s really important for the president and the public to know the value of climate science because of the threats to our economy, national security and children’s future,” said Steven Allison, associate professor of ecology & evolutionary biology and one of dozens at UCI to sign the letter. “It’s important for the scientific community to come together and speak with a unified voice on this.” </article>
