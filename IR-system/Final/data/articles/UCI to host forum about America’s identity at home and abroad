<article> EVENT:  The United States is facing a peculiar time in which it’s unusually difficult to take stock of ourselves. If we had to say what underpins America today, if we were forced to choose our core beliefs or values as a nation, it’s not clear that we could readily do so.
Keynote speaker Jill Lepore, author of The Secret History of Wonder Woman, and panels comprising thinkers and visionaries from America and all over the world, will focus on the many complicated ways to address and to answer this pressing and crucial question: Who Do We Think We Are?
WHEN/WHERE:   Friday, Feb. 9, and Saturday, Feb. 10, in the Crystal Cove Auditorium at the Student Center (bldg. 113, grid E8 on campus map: https://communications.uci.edu/documents/pdf/UCI_16_map_campus_core.pdf) and in the EDU 1111 classroom at the School of Law (bldg. 3, grid F11 on campus map)

Parking is available in the Student Center Parking Structure (grid D9 on campus map) and in the Social Sciences Parking Structure (grid F10 on campus map) for $10 per day or $2 per hour.
