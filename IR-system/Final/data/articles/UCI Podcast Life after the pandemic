Andrew Noymer, associate professor of public health at UCI, is an expert on public health responses to pandemics such as COVID-19 and their long-term consequences. In this special UCI Podcast, he discusses how and if/when life will return to normal after the coronavirus crisis. The good news is that social distancing seems to be working. In Orange County, COVID-19 infection rates are lower than predicted … for now. But, Noymer says, don’t expect to return to your normal routines anytime soon. The “new normal,” as many call it, will involve opening up the economy, but social distancing, wearing masks and washing hands repeatedly will remain. </article>
