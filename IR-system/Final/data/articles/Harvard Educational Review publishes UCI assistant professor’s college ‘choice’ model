<article> Constance Iloh, UCI assistant professor of education, describes her new conceptual model for the college decision-making process in an article published online in the summer 2018 issue of the Harvard Educational Review. The higher education landscape has seen massive changes over the past 20 years, driven by greater numbers of post-traditional students – including those who complete some college and re-enter months or years later, those who attend more than one institution and adult learners – as well as by the heightened visibility of community and for-profit colleges. Iloh asserts that traditional models of college choice are inadequate for understanding contemporary enrollment. “To address this issue, I’ve created the Iloh model of college-going decisions and trajectories, comprising information, time and opportunity,” she says. “These factors and their interdependent relationships illuminate the realities of diverse prospective students embedded in complex and evolving contexts. I also argue that the concept of ‘choice’ is a limited, problematic and privileged way of understanding a stratified education market and present-day college going, particularly for the most underserved communities in the system.” </article>
