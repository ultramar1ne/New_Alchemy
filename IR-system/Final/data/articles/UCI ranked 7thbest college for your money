<article> Money magazine scoured through 2,400 colleges and 27 data points to list the 711 top colleges, and once again, UCI rates highly for offering an affordable and accessible high-quality education coupled with alumni success. In Money’s 2017-18 Best College Rankings, UCI rated as the seventh-best college for your money (and fifth among public universities).
Most notable about the survey: UCI provides 62 percent of its student need-based grants, an amount no school ranked among Money’s top 25 can match. This recognition is the latest in a series of rankings that put UCI in the top tier of U.S. universities. Earlier this year, Money also included UCI in “The 25 Best Public Colleges for Big Paychecks.”
And for the second consecutive time, the campus tops The New York Times’ College Access Index of U.S. universities based on their commitment to economic diversity. The ranking takes into account the number of low- and middle-income students that a college enrolls and the price it charges them.
In addition, UCI was No. 8 in Forbes’ 2017 Best Value College survey, which judged 300 schools on their ability to deliver “the best bang for the tuition buck based on tuition costs, school quality, post-grad earnings, student debt and graduation success.” </article>
