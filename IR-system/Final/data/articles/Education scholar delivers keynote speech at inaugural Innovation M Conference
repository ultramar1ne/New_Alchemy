<article> Constance Iloh, assistant professor of education, was a keynote speaker at the inaugural Innovation M Conference, where she discussed her research on disruptive pervasive inequities in higher education. The conference focused on how the most pressing societal issues facing our nation intersect with innovation. Iloh presented her work on college access and the educational opportunity gaps confronting underrepresented populations to a standing-room-only audience. She also talked about current projects, including her forthcoming book from Johns Hopkins University Press on going to college in the 21st century and the for-profit sector, as well as her grant-funded research exploring virtual learning in vocational education. The conference was held Sept. 28-30 at Miami Dade College. </article>
