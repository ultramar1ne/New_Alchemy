<article> School of Education dean Richard Arum and distinguished professor Greg Duncan have been named to the 2021 RHSU Edu-Scholar Public Influence Rankings. The annual list recognizes the 200 university-based scholars in the country who had the most influence on educational practice and policy. Arum is principal investigator of the Next-Generation Undergraduate Success Measurement Project, supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. It involves data collection from more than 1,200 UCI undergraduates for two years to provide insights that will help improve our understanding of the value of their educational experiences and promote evidence-based models of student success. Duncan’s research focuses on economic mobility within and across generations, with a particular focus on low-income families. He’s currently working with a team conducting a random-assignment trial assessing the impacts of income supplements on the cognitive development of infants born to poor mothers in four diverse U.S. communities. Established in 2010, the RHSU rankings are compiled by Frederick Hess, resident scholar and director of Education Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. </article>
