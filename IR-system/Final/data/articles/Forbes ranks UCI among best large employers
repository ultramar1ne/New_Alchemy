<article> Forbes has named UCI one of the best large employers in the U.S. The campus rated No. 40 overall and No. 4 among educational institutes. This comes on the heels of a January Forbes ranking, in which UCI rated the seventh best for employee diversity – the second-highest ranking for both a California employer and an educational institute. UCI is Orange County’s second-largest employer, with 16,400 faculty and staff working on campus and at the UCI Medical Center and affiliate clinics.
UCI’s employment model nurtures engagement and strength in the workplace, focusing on the contributions of all employees, regardless of position, and a respect for all human differences, including age, culture, ethnicity, race, country of origin, linguistics, gender, socioeconomic status, education, religion, sexual orientation and ability/disability. From active diversity talent acquisition outreach to employee development, benefits, engagement opportunities, and an emphasis on work life balance and wellness, UCI strives to build and sustain an environment marked by inclusion, ownership, and stewardship of UCI’s mission.
“UCI understands and embraces the contributions people from different backgrounds and ideologies bring to the university,” said Ramona Agrela, UCI associate chancellor and chief human resources executive. “This is our strength and the foundation of ensuring that all employees feel supported and valued with a sense of belonging.”
Forbes partnered with market research company Statista for its ranking of the U.S.’s best employers. The 2019 list was compiled by surveying 50,000 Americans working for businesses with at least 1,000 employees. All the surveys were anonymous, allowing participants to openly share their opinions. Respondents were asked to rate their organizations on equality in various categories, as well as on general diversity. </article>
