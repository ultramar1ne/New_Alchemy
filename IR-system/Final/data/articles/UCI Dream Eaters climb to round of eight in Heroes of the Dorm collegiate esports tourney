<article> The UCI Dream Eaters continue to devour opponents’ hopes and dreams in Blizzard Entertainment’s Heroes of the Dorm collegiate tournament. The UCI esports squad secured a berth in the round of eight after a 2-0 defeat of the Snow Frogs from the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières in the round of 16. “We practiced hard in the weeks leading up to the tournament, knowing that the competition would get harder and any loss at this point would result in elimination,” said Dream Eaters captain Parsa Baghai. “We studied footage of UQTR’s previous games weeks ahead of time, before we knew that we would be matched against them.” He added: “Our win was convincing because in addition to preparing for UQTR, we placed a large emphasis on adapting to some recent changes in the ‘Heroes of the Storm’ game.” Continuing its quest to capture the biggest prize pool in collegiate esports – three years of tuition for winning team members – UCI squares off Wednesday against ImprobaBull Victory from the University at Buffalo. Match updates are available through UCI Esports’ Facebook and Twitter pages. The tournament is being streamed for free on Twitch. </article>
