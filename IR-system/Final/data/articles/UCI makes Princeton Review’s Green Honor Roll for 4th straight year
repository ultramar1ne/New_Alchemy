<article> For the fourth year in a row, UCI has won a spot on The Princeton Review’s Green Honor Roll, which rates schools on the environmental friendliness of their policies and practices, academic offerings and quality of campus life. Out of 640 colleges surveyed for the 2017 list, UCI was one of just 21 to earn a perfect score. UC Santa Cruz also made the honor roll. </article>
