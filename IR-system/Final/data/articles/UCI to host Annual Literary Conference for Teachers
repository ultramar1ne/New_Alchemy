<article> More than 500 educators from Southern California are registered to attend the 17th Annual Literacy Conference for Teachers, hosted by the UCI Writing Project, on Dec. 13. This year’s theme is “Teaching Better by Design: Helping Students to Dive Deep as Readers and Writers.” The event features two keynote addresses and a variety of workshops. “We created this literacy conference to bring together mostly English teachers – but other teachers as well – to keep them abreast of the most important research and practices in K-12 reading and writing,” said Carol Booth Olson, director of the UCI Writing Project and professor of education. “Attendees will be exposed to important books and thinking, along with evidence-based best practices, presented by distinguished professors and scholars from across the country.” The conference runs from 8 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. at the UCI Student Center. </article>
