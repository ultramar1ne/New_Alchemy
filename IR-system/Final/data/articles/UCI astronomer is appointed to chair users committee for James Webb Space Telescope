UCI astronomer James Bullock has been appointed chair of the James Webb Space Telescope users committee. The group, which includes 10 to 14 American, European and Canadian scientists, was established to ensure that the observatory is operated in such a way as to maximize its scientific performance. The JWST, successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, is scheduled to launch in late 2018. From its position in outer space, more than a million miles from Earth, the telescope will study exoplanets in the Milky Way and the earliest stars and galaxies in the universe in infrared and visible light wavelengths. “We expect to achieve some amazing scientific breakthroughs with Webb,” said Bullock, professor of physics & astronomy. “But it’s important that we coordinate our efforts as astronomers here on Earth so that we’re using this valuable tool in the most effective way possible.” The users committee will convene twice a year, with the first meeting at Baltimore’s Space Telescope Science Institute in mid-September. </article>
