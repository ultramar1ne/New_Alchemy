<article> Irvine, Calif., Aug. 10, 2016 — Highlighted by the largest gift in campus history and an investment of more than $40 million in cancer studies, the University of California, Irvine continues advancing toward its brilliant future with a record-breaking year in both research funding and philanthropic support.
For fiscal 2015-16, the Office of Research reported $395 million in grants and contracts, and University Advancement reported $132.5 million in gifts, shattering the previous year’s totals in both areas. From state and federal agencies, leading foundations and individual donors, the funding represents the growing support UCI is receiving for its world-class research and facilities, community-based programs, top-ranked faculty and diverse student body.
“As UCI completes its 50th anniversary celebration and enacts an ambitious strategic plan for unprecedented growth and engagement, this record support signifies our rapid ascent in the ranks of the finest research institutions,” said Chancellor Howard Gillman. “The burgeoning culture of philanthropy is central to achieving our bold ambitions and to igniting and expanding the contributions that UCI can bring to our region and to the world.” </article>
