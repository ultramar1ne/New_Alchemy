<article> UCI’s men’s rowing team began early preseason efforts with a successful outing in the San Diego Fall Classic rowing regatta. It took gold in the open-class “four-with,” silver in the open pair and bronze in the open eight. In addition, the men’s novice team placed sixth in the freshman/novice eight after only three weeks of on-the-water training and with a crew of all walk-on athletes. Unlike shorter rowing races during the spring racing season, the Fall Classic is a “head race.” Boats in each event took off in a staggered start and competed over a winding 5-kilometer course around San Diego’s Mission Bay. Many universities were represented, including UC San Diego, UCLA and UC Santa Barbara. Conditions were sunny and clear, making for excellent racing and spectating.
