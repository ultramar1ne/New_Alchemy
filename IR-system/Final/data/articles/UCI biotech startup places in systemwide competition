<article> Laser Associated Sciences has received $50,000 for placing second in primeUC, a systemwide competition for early-stage companies involved in the development of innovative life science technologies. The competition was part of UC President Janet Napolitano’s Innovation & Entrepreneurship Initiative, which aims to help startups affiliated with the university. Founded by UCI Beckman Laser Institute graduates Sean White, Bruce Yang and Tyler Rice, Laser Associated Sciences has originated noninvasive laser technology to measure microvascular blood flow. Its first product, the FlowMet, is a clip-on device similar to a pulse oximeter that’s capable of gauging peripheral blood flow continuously and in real time. Future development will include home-based blood flow monitors for postoperative use. BLI has invested in FlowMet to study subtle alterations in peripheral blood flow resulting from various physiological interventions. Laser Associated Sciences is currently based at The Cove, Applied Innovation’s collaborative work space at UCI for inventors, entrepreneurs, accelerators and incubators. UCI had two other finalists in the primeUC competition: TinyKicks and Glixis. Overall, there were 263 entries across the UC system. </article>
