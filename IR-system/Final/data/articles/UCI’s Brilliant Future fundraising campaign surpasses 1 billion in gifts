<article> Irvine, Calif., April 6, 2021 – Alumni and friends of the University of California, Irvine have raised more than $1 billion to support scholarships, groundbreaking research, top-notch patient care and world-class educational facilities, among other initiatives.
The $1 billion total pushes UCI across the halfway mark in its $2 billion philanthropic effort, Brilliant Future: The Campaign for UCI, which has also engaged 44,000 alumni so far – more than half the goal of 75,000 by 2024.
The Brilliant Future campaign publicly launched in October 2019. It is the most ambitious fundraising and alumni engagement effort in UCI’s history. To date, more than 68,000 supporters have given to the university as part of the campaign.
Those gifts to UCI and UCI Health have contributed to the construction of new buildings and the creation of more than 140 new scholarships, fellowships and student awards, as well as the establishment of 38 endowed chairs that support pioneering research. Donations of all sizes have bolstered the university’s COVID-19 response by enabling UCI Health to purchase essential equipment and lifesaving supplies.
“During one of the most challenging health crises in recent times, it’s inspiring to see that the generosity of our UCI alumni and friends has not only endured but intensified,” said Chancellor Howard Gillman. “We are incredibly grateful for all of our alumni and friends as we work to fulfill our mission of research, teaching and public service.”
In 2020, donors accelerated their giving, both for UCI’s COVID-19 efforts and for longstanding goals. The amount raised for student support alone increased by more than 40 percent between 2019 and 2020. Additionally, the university received 15 more gifts greater than $1 million in 2020 than in 2019. The outlook for 2021 is optimistic. </article>
