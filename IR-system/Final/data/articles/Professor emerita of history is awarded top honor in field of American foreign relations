<article> Emily Rosenberg, professor emerita of history and former chair of that department, has been given the highest honor in the field of U.S. foreign relations – the Norman and Laura Graebner Award – by the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. The Graebner Award recognizes the lifetime achievement of a senior historian of U.S. foreign relations who has significantly contributed to the field through scholarship, teaching and/or service over his or her career. The award committee commended Rosenberg’s years of teaching at UCI and Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her scholarship includes more than a dozen books and some 70 articles, essays and scholarly introductions. Rosenberg’s work, the committee wrote, “has had a profound impact on the field; it anticipated the cultural turn in the field and practically introduced the history of globalization.” In addition to her academic accomplishments, Rosenberg is known on the UCI campus for her commitment to students, having been named Professor of the Year in 2010. In June, she’ll receive the award at the SHAFR annual meeting in Washington, D.C. </article>
