BACKGROUND: Amateur and pro female video gamers have faced tough odds, harassment and threats, including Gamergate. Yet equal numbers of women and men now play online games. As collegiate and professional eSports teams expand and viewership skyrockets globally, players and academics say it’s critical to break down gender barriers. The question is how.
“This conversation is meant to inspire young women to pursue gaming as a hobby and as a career and to generate action that encourages and supports inclusive gaming on campus and beyond,” said panel moderator Cullen, who researches fan activity.
The event is co-sponsored by the Department of Informatics at the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences, UCI eSports and the Women’s Empowerment Initiative, in partnership with AnyKey.
