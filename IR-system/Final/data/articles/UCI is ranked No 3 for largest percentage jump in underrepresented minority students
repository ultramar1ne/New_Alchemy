<article> UCI is ranked No. 3 by The Chronicle of Higher Education among public doctorate-awarding institutions with the largest increases in percentage of underrepresented minorities in the student body. The campus is also the only member of the prestigious Association of American Universities in the top 10. The 62-member AAU comprises the country’s leading research institutions. In 2016, underrepresented minority enrollment at UCI was 32.3 percent, compared to just 18.6 percent in 2010, a jump of 13.8 percentage points. The list is based on enrollment data compiled by the U.S. Department of Education for American Indians and Alaska natives, blacks and Hispanics – all groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education. Doctoral, master’s and liberal arts colleges upped their student percentages of American Indians, blacks and Hispanics faster than those populations grew in the U.S. between 2010 and 2016. </article>
