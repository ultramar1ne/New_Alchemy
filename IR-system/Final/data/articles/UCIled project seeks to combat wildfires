<article> A University of California, Irvine-led team has received $3.6 million over three years for a project that uses science and engineering to help California fight wildfires. The funding comes from the University of California Laboratory Fees Research Program competition, a contest designed to promote the development of multicampus projects and collaborations that advance the missions of the national laboratories and University of California.
As wildfires in California grow more frequent and severe, experts point to a number of reasons for the concerning trend, including a policy of active fire suppression that has led to a massive fuel accumulation over the last century. Coupled with tree mortality, drought and climate change has resulted in a year-round fire season and an increase in life-threatening megafires.
According to principal investigator Tirtha Banerjee, UCI assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, one of the most effective tools for reducing wildland fuels (vegetation) and wildfire severity is intentionally setting controlled fires, or prescribed burns.
“In other parts of the United States, and especially in the Southeast, prescribed fire is a primary tool for managing fuels and fire risk, but in California the use and benefits of this optimal approach are far from meeting their full potential,” said Banerjee, who joined the UCI faculty in July 2019. “Our goal is to apply modeling, data science and risk-management strategies to the problem and help lower the current barriers to widespread application of prescribed fires.”
The research will integrate physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science and ecology to conduct and disseminate information supporting an increase in the pace and scale of prescribed fires in the region.
“Prescribed burns are a preemptive way to create community resilience by preventing wildfire events from escalating into large catastrophes that have human, environmental and economic impact,” said Nalini Venkatasubramanian, UCI professor of computer science and a co-PI on the grant along with computer science Professor Sharad Mehrotra. </article>
