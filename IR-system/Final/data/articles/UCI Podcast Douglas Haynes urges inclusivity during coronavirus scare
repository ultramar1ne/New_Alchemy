<article> In the latest UCI Podcast, Douglas Haynes, vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion, shares a message with the UCI community about inclusivity during challenging times. The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus, now called COVID-19, a global health emergency. This pandemic has far-reaching effects on physical as well as mental health. Fear, stress and anxiety, for example, can lead to behavioral changes â€“ intentional or not. As the medical community works to understand this novel disease, Haynes reminds us that while the human reaction in such circumstances may be to protect oneself, we must prioritize inclusivity. </article>
