<article> The American Meteorological Society has awarded Efi Foufoula-Georgiou the 2017 Hydrologic Sciences Medal for “her pioneering contributions to the science of hydrometeorology and for visionary and sustained leadership in advancing interdisciplinary hydrologic research.” A UCI Distinguished Professor of civil & environmental engineering, Foufoula-Georgiou is considered one of the world’s leading hydrologists and water resources engineers. Her research focuses on hydrology and geomorphology, with special attention to scaling theories, multiscale dynamics, and space-time modeling of precipitation and landforms. Her innovations have improved predictions of space-time variabilities, as well as understanding of water, sediment and land processes in response to climate and human disturbances. “I am deeply honored and humbled by the award, and I am particularly proud to see that it recognizes not only my own research but my strong belief in and commitment to promoting and enabling interdisciplinary research,” Foufoula-Georgiou said. “I’m looking forward to an exciting journey at UCI.” </article>
