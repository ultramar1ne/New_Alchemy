<article> A research paper written by UCI Heart Disease Prevention Program researchers was chosen by Hypertension as the top 2015 paper in the category of population science. The American Heart Association journal annually selects the best original work published in its pages in the categories of basic, clinical and population sciences. The UCI study – “Does Low Diastolic Blood Pressure Contribute to the Risk of Recurrent Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease Events” – used Framingham Heart Study data to show that, regardless of the presence or absence of antihypertensive treatment, persistent systolic hypertension coupled with low diastolic blood pressure increases the risk of reoccurring cardiovascular conditions. Dr. Stanley Franklin, Sohum Gokhale, Vincent Chow and Nathan Wong of UCI’s Heart Disease Prevention Program – which is part of the cardiology division in UC Irvine Health’s Department of Medicine – contributed to the study, led by Franklin. “As only one paper a year in this category is chosen, this is a very prestigious award,” he said.
