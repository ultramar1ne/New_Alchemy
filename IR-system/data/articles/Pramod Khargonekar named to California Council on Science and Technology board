<article> UCI Vice Chancellor of Research and Distinguished Professor Pramod Khargonekar is among five eminent leaders in science, engineering, policy and philanthropy named to the California Council on Science and Technology’s board of directors. The council is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization established via the California State Legislature in 1988 to respond to the Governor, the Legislature, and other state entities who request independent assessment of public policy issues affecting the State of California relating to science and technology. In addition to leading a half-billion-dollar research enterprise at UCI, Khargonekar has unparalleled expertise in science and technology research, innovation and public policy. Before joining UCI, he served the National Science Foundation as its assistant director for the Directorate of Engineering.
“Dr. Khargonekar combines renowned engineering and policy expertise with a vision for California to be competitive in a global landscape,” said CCST Board Chair Peter Cowhey. “His experience with the National Science Foundation will provide critical insights into how California can enhance its leadership in the US and globally by making strategic investments in science and technology and tapping into institutional partnerships.”
