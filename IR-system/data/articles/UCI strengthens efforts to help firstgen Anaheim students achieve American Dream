<article> UCI Chancellor Howard Gillman and leaders from other Orange County higher educational institutions signed the Anaheim Union Educational Pledge at a special ceremony at John F. Kennedy High School on Sept. 27. The pledge represents commitments from partners who are dedicated to providing opportunities that enhance pathways to success in higher education and future careers for all AUHSD graduates.
“Our mission is to serve all the people of this great state by offering the finest education to its top students, regardless of circumstance,” Gillman told the packed auditorium in the AUHSD Performing Arts Center. “At UCI, we have been doing that since our founding more than 50 years ago. With the pledge that I will sign in a few moments, UCI is renewing that commitment.”
UCI will provide guaranteed admission to all AUHSD graduates who enroll at Cypress College or Fullerton College who meet the eligibility requirements of the Transfer Admission Guarantee program.
“Recognized as the number one campus in the country for doing the most for the American dream, our commitment to Anaheim’s students does not end when they are admitted,” Gillman said. “We devote attention and resources to student success all the way to graduation and preparation for careers and postgraduate education. We have one of the highest graduation rates in the entire nation, and many of our best students come from the greater Anaheim community.”
Academic leaders from California State Fullerton, North Orange County Community College District and AUHSD, along with Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait, also signed the pledge. </article>
