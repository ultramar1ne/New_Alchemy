<article> Dear UCI Community:
Nearly a week has passed since we informed you of a confirmed case of measles on our campus and we’re happy to report that no additional cases have been confirmed on campus or in Orange County – though it continues to be a public health concern nationally.
We continue to work with the Orange County Health Care Agency, UC Irvine Medical Center, and other community partners to keep our campus healthy and inform you of new developments as rapidly as possible. The majority of those exposed through the affected areas have been cleared through documented immunity, and a few others were cleared through lab tests.
The best way to protect yourself from the measles and other communicable diseases is through immunizations. It is essential to the health of our entire campus that all students receive vaccinations with documentation and upload their immunity status to the UCI Student Health Portal account. Faculty and staff should review their health records or visit a medical provider to ensure their immunity status.
We appreciate the support and assistance of our students, faculty and staff as we addressed this matter. For those who updated their medical information – thank you for taking the time and effort to improve the overall health of our community.
Be well,
Albert Chang, MD, MPH
Medical Director, UCI Student Health Center </article>
