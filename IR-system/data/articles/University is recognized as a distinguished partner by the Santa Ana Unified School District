<article> UCI was recognized as a Santa Ana Unified School District distinguished partner at the 2017 State of the District Breakfast on Oct. 13. “UCI was selected along with two other agencies because of the wide range of opportunities that the university has extended to the students of Santa Ana,” said Stefanie Phillips, SAUSD superintendent. UCI offers guidance and resources to SAUSD high school students, advising them on courses to take and academic preparation and assisting with the college application process. One focus of UCI’s positive outreach efforts is the Anteater Academy, a college prep program and small learning community at Santa Ana’s Valley High School. “We are committed to creating a society of equal opportunity for all, and so we’re going to lean into our communities and engage with our partners,” said Richard Arum, dean of UCI’s School of Education. “It’s critically important that we come together to address this pressing need in our society. Now more than ever, it’s essential that young people have an education, because without it, it’s impossible to compete in the labor market of the future and also impossible for our democratic society to flourish.” In May, the U.S. Department of Education named UCI a Hispanic-serving institution for 2017-18, a designation that requires Latino student enrollment of at least 25 percent. On campus, UCI invests in the success of these students through scholarships, internships, mentorships and leadership development programs such as SAGE Scholars. </article>
