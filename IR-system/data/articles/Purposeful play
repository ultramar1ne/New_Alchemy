<article> Expect to make new friends and up your fun quota at this year’s Anteater Equity Games, slated for 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, May 4.
“We’ve seen a big growth in participation since our first games in 2014,” says history professor Doug Haynes, who’s overseeing the festivities. “This growth reflects the interest of faculty, staff and students in being part of building a new campus tradition, one that’s indispensable in creating an affirmative and supportive culture for all.”
Planners expect about 200 participants to congregate in Aldrich Park for brain games and physical challenges. The third annual event offers an opportunity to forge new relationships by competing in diverse teams, says Haynes, vice provost for academic equity, diversity and inclusion.
Games this year will be more interactive and accessible to those of all fitness levels. Registration remains open, and spectators are welcome.
“Colleagues across campus are excited,” says Dina Jankowski, logistics manager for the event. “After the games, I receive emails and phone calls from folks who want to tell me how much they enjoyed them. With new challenges and departments participating, we expect this year to be great.” </article>
