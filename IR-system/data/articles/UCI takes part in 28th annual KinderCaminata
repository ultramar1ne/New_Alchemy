<article> UCI faculty and staff participated in the 28th annual KinderCaminata program, designed to inspire kindergartners to attend college and plan their careers. This year’s virtual event, on March 25 and 26, included videos from UCI, Cal State Fullerton, Santa Ana College, the Santa Ana Police Department, the Santa Ana Library, the Orange County Health Care Agency, the Orange County Registrar of Voters and the Girl Scouts of Orange County, shown during class. KinderCaminata is held each year on or near the March 31 birthday of late labor leader and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez. “It’s one way UCI celebrates the life of Cesar Chavez and turns his legacy into meaningful action,” says Stephanie Reyes-Tuccio, assistant vice chancellor for educational partnerships. “It’s a labor of love to create.” </article>
