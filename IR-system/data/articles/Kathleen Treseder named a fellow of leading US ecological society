<article> Kathleen Treseder, professor of ecology & evolutionary biology, has been elected a fellow of the Ecological Society of America in 2016 in recognition of advancing the science of ecology. Specifically, the ESA cited her leadership in evaluating and communicating the importance of fungi in ecosystems, including in mediating ecosystem responses to global climate change. “This topic is challenging to study, because fungi operate at the microscopic scale, yet elicit consequences for biogeochemical functions at the global scale,” she said. “Our research targets scales ranging from the molecule to the globe. It’s an honor to be recognized as a fellow of the ESA.” Fellows are members who have made outstanding contributions to a wide range of fields served by ESA, including, but not restricted to those that advance or apply ecological knowledge in academics, government, non-profit organizations and the broader society. They are elected for life. Treseder received her doctorate in biological sciences from Stanford University. She joined UCI in 2003 and served as a Chancellor’s Fellow here from 2012-15. </article>
