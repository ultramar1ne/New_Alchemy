<article> UCI’s Regina Ragan, associate professor of chemical engineering & materials science, has been named a Fulbright U.S. Scholar and will collaborate with researchers at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany through the Fulbright Flex program. Ragan’s work involves developing new processes in advanced manufacturing of nanoscale devices. She is creating technology that employs optical sensing to detect metabolites that serve as biomarkers of disease. At KIT, she will implement her pioneering methods for nanomanufacturing nanophotonic devices and investigate their use in next-generation medical diagnostic tools. “I am honored to be selected among the prestigious group of Fulbright Scholars,” Ragan said. “It’s an exciting opportunity to engage with leaders in Germany who have made significant strides in large-area manufacturing of nanostructures and are effectively working with industry for technology transfer.” With two annual visits to Germany, she will coordinate research between her UCI group and her KIT collaborators. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational & Cultural Affairs, Fulbright is the government’s flagship program in international educational exchange. The Core Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program sends about 800 American academics and professionals per year to approximately 130 countries, where they lecture and/or conduct research in a wide variety of fields. </article>
