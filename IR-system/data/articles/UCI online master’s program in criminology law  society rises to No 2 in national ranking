<article> UCI’s Master of Advanced Study in criminology, law & society has advanced to No. 2 in the country in U.S. News & World Report‘s 2019 ranking of the Best Online Graduate Criminal Justice Programs. A total of 77 schools with online criminal justice or criminology programs were evaluated in five categories: engagement, expert opinion, faculty credentials and training, services and technologies, and student excellence. “We are delighted that our program moved up to second place this year from third place last year,” said Susan Turner, UCI professor of criminology, law & society and M.A.S. program director. “This is a testament to the extraordinary education our graduate students are receiving.” For professionals in corrections, probation, parole, law enforcement, social services and various public administration roles, completing an online graduate degree may be the most practical way to further their career, whether that means changing fields or advancing into management. </article>
