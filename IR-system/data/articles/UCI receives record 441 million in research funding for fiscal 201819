Awards from federal and state agencies, leading foundations and forward-thinking companies increased 22 percent over 2017-18 totals, reflecting strong and burgeoning support for UCI’s top-ranked faculty, first-rate facilities, diverse and talented student body, and community-based programs.
 
“This research funding milestone signifies progress toward our campus strategic plan goals while accelerating UCI’s ascent among its Association of American Universities peers, having a meaningful impact on regional economic development and making strides to improve society through globally prominent research,” said Enrique Lavernia, UCI provost and executive vice chancellor.
UCI Health experienced the greatest boost in research funding. The School of Medicine garnered $155 million, which accounted for 35 percent of UCI’s 2018-19 total and was 23 percent more than in 2017-18. The Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center brought in $25 million – a 21 percent jump from last year – for research, patient care and clinical trials; and the Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders reaped $30 million, a 39 percent increase.
Support from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, which encompasses the National Institutes of Health, the largest single source of research funding at UCI, rose 20 percent over last year to $157 million. The National Science Foundation provided $55 million, 10 percent more than in 2017-18. And private backing from foundations and charitable trusts reached $62 million, a 15 percent hike.
“Our faculty, students and staff are truly excelling in an environment of tremendous competition for financial support for research and innovation,” said Pramod Khargonekar, vice chancellor for research at UCI. “Research is a central mission for us, and these outstanding results indicate that UCI’s world-class research enterprise will continue to make important, productive contributions to the state, the nation and the world.”
