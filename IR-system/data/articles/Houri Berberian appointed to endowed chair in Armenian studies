<article> Houri Berberian has been named the School of Humanities’ Meghrouni Family Presidential Chair in Armenian Studies. The $2 million endowed chair was established in 2014 by Vahe and Armine Meghrouni, with additional backing from the local Armenian American community and a $500,000 match from the UC Office of the President. Berberian joins UCI from California State University, Long Beach, where she was a professor of Middle Eastern history and director of the Middle Eastern studies program. She is the author of numerous articles and a book, Armenians & the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911: The Love for Freedom Has No Fatherland. At UCI, Berberian will create an integrated study program on Armenians and Armenia. She says her vision is to “develop a forward-looking and dynamic center for both undergraduate and graduate training in the field. Also, I very much look forward to contributing to the intellectual and cultural life of the wider community through organizing public events, including lectures and academic conferences.” Read the full release here. </article>
