<article> Bill Maurer, dean of the School of Social Sciences, will moderate a panel discussion featuring research sponsors from federal agencies and other government organizations at the 20th anniversary meeting of the National Academy of Sciences Board on Behavioral, Cognitive & Sensory Sciences. “It’s really quite exciting to participate in a forum that showcases the very best research – from rewiring the brain to the human-technology interface – and the role of the behavioral sciences in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Maurer said. “Our theme is the limitless future for the behavioral sciences, a future that will be marked by rapid social, environmental and digital transformation.” The event provides an opportunity to discuss how federal research budgets can anticipate how the behavioral sciences field can meet the challenges emerging over the next five, 10 and 20 years. The board was created two decades ago by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering & Medicine to bring together an interdisciplinary community of top scholars to offer insights to federal policymakers from a behavioral sciences perspective on issues ranging from military accessioning to how children learn. This year’s meeting will be held Oct. 19 at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. </article>
