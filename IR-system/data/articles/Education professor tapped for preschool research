<article> A UCI education professor has been drafted to help investigate why the usual benefits of preschool don’t always carry over to elementary school, especially for students from low-income families. Chancellor’s Professor Carol Connor will receive a $2 million grant from the Institute of Education Sciences as part of a five-year national research effort to improve early childhood education. The IES is an arm of the U.S. Department of Education. For more information on the IES research program, see http://ies.ed.gov/whatsnew/pressreleases/01_19_2016.asp. </article>
