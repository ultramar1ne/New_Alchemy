BACKGROUND:  Chu received the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics for the development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light. He served as U.S. secretary of energy from 2009 to 2013. Prior to his appointment, Chu was director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he led the pursuit of alternative and renewable energy technologies. Previously, he held positions at Stanford University and AT&T Bell Laboratories. Chu is a vocal advocate for more research into renewable energy and nuclear power, arguing that a shift away from fossil fuels is essential to combating climate change. He is a member of numerous prestigious societies and has received 27 honorary degrees. The Reines Lecture honors Frederick Reines, UCI’s founding dean of physical sciences and co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of the neutrino.
