<article> Members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which represents service workers and patient care technical workers at UCI, have elected to go on strike from Monday, May 7Â until early on Thursday, May 10.
The AFSCME union strike affects all UC campuses, including the UCI campus, the UCI Health Medical Center and Douglas Hospital in Orange, Gottschalk Medical Plaza, and other medical care locations operated by UCI. Union members may choose to demonstrate on UCI facilities during this period.
Two additional unions currently in bargaining negotiations with UC, the California Nurses Association and the University Professional and Technical Employees, have voted to participate in the strike in sympathy with the AFSCME service staff members.
At this time, all university activities, including classes and medical center operations, are going on as scheduled, with no interruption of service. UCI has taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our students, patients, faculty, staff, medical professionals and community members, and ensure that strike activities have minimal impact on UCI locations and the surrounding community.
For more information, contact the UCI Strike Command Center through the UCI Police department at (949) 824-5223. </article>
