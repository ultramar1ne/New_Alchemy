<article> The University of California, Irvine is the 15th best public university for providing students with the highest average salaries for their tuition dollars. CNBC Make It ranked the top 50 colleges – 25 private and 25 public – that pay off the most to help estimate college costs, which helps students from taking on on significant amounts of debt to finance a degree.
College net costs were calculated using data from Tuition Tracker for a family making between $48,001 and $75,000, which includes the median U.S. household income of $61,372. That number was then divided by the expected annual earnings for graduates from the top 200 schools in PayScale’s College Salary Report.
Greater weight was given to earnings in workers’ first five years, when individuals are most impacted by student debt. The average cost of a UCI bachelor’s degree is $13,820 and alumni’s salary average in yearly and mid career is $89,750.
Earlier this year, UCI was ranked No. 3 in Forbes’ 2019 Best Value College survey. </article>
