<article> Jean-Luc Gaudiot, UCI professor of electrical engineering & computer science at The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, was recently voted 2016 president-elect of the IEEE Computer Society, an international organization dedicated to all aspects of modern computing technology. An IEEE fellow, Gaudiot will begin his term Jan. 1, 2016; he automatically will ascend to the society’s presidency in 2017. Gaudiot most recently served as vice president of the IEEE publications board and has also been program committee chair and co-chair, editor-in-chief of IEEE Transactions on Computers, founding editor of IEEE Computer Architecture Letters, vice president of educational activities, and vice president of publications. In his new role, Gaudiot plans to increase delivery of benefits to IEEE members, improve communication, seek new collaborations and projects, expand the organization’s reach and promote member involvement. “In contrast to many who are fearful of the changes the Internet has brought us, I know our best days are ahead of us,” he said. “Opportunities for innovation abound in this changing world, and the community is looking to us to lead the way and demonstrate how these new opportunities can be exploited.” Gaudiot is also an IEEE Computer Society Golden Core member and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His research interests include programmability and design of multiprocessors, and he has published more than 250 peer-reviewed papers.
