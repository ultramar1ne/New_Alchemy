<article> In the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education rankings of top U.S. colleges in 2018, UCI rated third for providing a productive learning environment. For that category, which constitutes 10 percent of the overall rankings, the Journal/Times reviewed how colleges succeed in attracting a diverse student body and offering outlets and opportunities for these students to thrive. Specifically, the reviewers looked for the proportion of international students, student diversity, student inclusion and staff diversity. In 2017, UCI received federal recognition for its student diversity, gaining Hispanic-serving institution and Asian American & Native American Pacific Islander-serving institution status, demonstrating the universityâ€™s dedication to providing a world-class education to every qualified student. Additionally, UCI is the No. 1 choice among UC campuses for in-state Latino high school graduates and No. 2 for African Americans. Overall, UCI was ranked No. 7 in the West among public universities by the Journal/Times. </article>
