<article> Irvine, Calif., April 25, 2019 — Willie L. Banks Jr. has been named vice chancellor for student affairs at the University of California, Irvine, effective July 15. He comes to UCI from Indiana State University, where he has served as vice president for student affairs for the past four years. At UCI, Banks will oversee the Student Affairs division and its mission of enriching the student experience for the campus’s nearly 30,000 undergraduates.
“Dr. Banks’ broad experience in the areas of campus life and student affairs makes him the right person to lead our student life and leadership programs and advance our efforts to enhance the undergraduate experience for all our students,” said Chancellor Howard Gillman.
Specifically, Banks will head up financial operations, auxiliary services and business enterprises – including student government, the bookstore, housing and hospitality – as well as commencement; scholarship and special programs; academic integrity; student conduct; student diversity organizations; Greek life; and student health, wellness and counseling services.
“UCI is thrilled to have Dr. Banks join us as vice chancellor for student affairs,” said Enrique Lavernia, UCI provost and executive vice chancellor. “His experience supporting students from diverse backgrounds will help UCI advance our strategic goals of expanding access to Californians from low-income households, elevating the student experience, preparing future leaders and promoting academic excellence for all students.”
Prior to his time at Indiana State University, Banks served as associate dean of students, interim assistant vice president for student affairs and interim vice president for student affairs at Cleveland State University. For the previous 18 years, he worked at the University of Georgia in a variety of positions within the Student Affairs division.
Banks earned a bachelor’s degree at Georgia’s Mercer University and a master’s in education and a Ph.D. in college student affairs administration at the University of Georgia.
“It’s an honor to join the exceptional faculty, staff and students of UCI,” he said. “I look forward to supporting the university’s strategies to integrate student life with academic experiences and, in particular, to ensure that UCI’s educational opportunities are an engine for social mobility, impact and innovation. Further, I am passionate about embracing the whole student, making certain that each has the best possible experience both academically and with student life.”
Banks replaces Edgar Dormitorio, who has been interim vice chancellor for student affairs since 2018. </article>
