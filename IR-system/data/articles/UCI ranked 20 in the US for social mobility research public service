<article> Washington Monthly has named the University of California, Irvine #20 in the nation out of more than 300 colleges and universities for promoting upward social mobility, producing cutting-edge research and encouraging students to give back to the community. Each component is equally weighted, so the top-ranked universities must excel across the breadth of measures, not just one. Colleges that are doing the best job of helping low-income students attain marketable degrees at a fair price are also rated, but on a regional basis. UCI came in at #18 out of 50 in the Western Region, using criteria including net cost, availability of financial aid, economic outcomes and student loan repayment. </article>
