<article> UCI’s esports organization is the focus of a four-part documentary series, the first three episodes of which premiere on ESPN2 on Tuesday, May 21, at 5 p.m. PST. Good Game: UC Irvine follows UCI’s varsity computer gaming team in the lead-up to the defense of their title in the 2019 League of Legends College Championship. The team will compete in the Riot Games LCS Battle Arena in west Los Angeles May 23-26. During the filming of the ESPN2 docuseries, film crews accompanied Anteater video gamers through their normal campus activities of studying, practicing and working with UCI Esports team member support staff in preparation for the tough competitions ahead, and they even followed players into their dorms and families’ homes. “We opened the door to the ESPN2 producers to provide a complete, unvarnished view of the lives of elite level collegiate gamers,” said Mark Deppe, director of UCI Esports. “We are excited for the world to see what it’s like to be part of one of the world’s leading college esports programs.” League of Legends is a dominant video game property, with more than 100 million monthly players. The 2018-2019 collegiate championship features more than 350 university teams competing for a million dollars in scholarship money from LoL developer Riot Games. The Anthill Pub & Grille and various UCI dining facilities are hosting viewing parties for Good Game: UC Irvine, and the series will be available on demand following the initial airing through the ESPN2 app. The College League of Legends tournament happening this weekend can be viewed on Twitch TV. </article>
