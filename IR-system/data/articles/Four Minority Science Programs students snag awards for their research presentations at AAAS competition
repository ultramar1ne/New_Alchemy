<article> Four University of California, Irvine undergraduates participating in the Francisco J. Ayala School of Biological Sciences Minority Science Programs received awards for their research presentations at the poster competition of the 2016 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences in Washington D.C. The AAAS is the worldâ€™s largest general scientific society. The research poster competition is open to undergraduate and graduate students from domestic and international institutions. The UCI winners and their categories are: Carolina Herrera (winner) and Mohamad Dandan (honorable mention) in developmental biology, physiology and immunology; Tiffany Batarseh (winner) in environment and ecology; and Cynthia Rodriguez (honorable mention) in medicine and public health. Their awards will be recognized in the March 25, 2016, issue of Science and here. UCI students in the Minority Science Programs are supported by training grants funded by the National Institutes of Health. The aim is to prepare them to pursue doctoral degrees and careers in biomedical research. </article>
