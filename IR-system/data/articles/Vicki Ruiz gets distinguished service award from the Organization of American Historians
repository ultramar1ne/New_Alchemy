<article> Vicki Ruiz, Distinguished Professor Emerita of history and Chicano/Latino studies, has received the 2019 Roy Rosenzweig Distinguished Service Award from the Organization of American Historians. The annual award recognizes those who have significantly enriched the understanding and appreciation of American history. Ruiz led the way in making Chicano/Latino history fully part of U.S. history, highlighting the lives and labor of Mexican American women and opening new lines of inquiry for future scholars with her groundbreaking first book, Cannery Women, Cannery Lives: Mexican Women, Unionization, and the California Food Processing Industry, 1930-1950 (University of New Mexico Press, 1987). She also wrote the first survey of 20th-century Mexican women in the U.S., From Out of the Shadows (Oxford University Press, 1998), now in its 10th edition, and has produced collaborative volumes and classroom texts that have made the fields of womenâ€™s, gender and ethnic history more inclusive. The award was presented at the annual meeting of the Organization of American Historians in Philadelphia in April. </article>
