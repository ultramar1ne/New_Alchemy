UCI is a charter members of SEA Change – the initiative of the American Association for the Advancement of Science to support colleges and universities as they systematically transform themselves into diverse, equitable and inclusive institutions. SEA Change, short for STEMM Equity Achievement, supports institutions as they undergo a rigorous self-assessment process to interrogate their own culture, policies and procedures that stand in the way of access and success for students, faculty and staff from groups marginalized in STEMM. From this self-assessment, participating institutions create individualized action plans and carry out changes that break down barriers for those excluded or marginalized based on gender, race, ethnicity, disability status or any other aspect of identity that has been a source of bias in STEMM.
SEA Change is “an opportunity and a lever to accelerate our ongoing efforts in institutional transformation,” said Douglas Haynes, chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion at UC Irvine.
UCI joins other university charter members in a national network publicly committed to creating sustainable changes to recruit, retain and advance the full range of diverse talent in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine. </article>
