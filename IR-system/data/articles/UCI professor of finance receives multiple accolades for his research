<article> David Hirshleifer, professor of finance and Paul Merage Chair in Business Growth, was recently elected vice president of the American Finance Association and appointed to the National Bureau of Economic Research. He also received The Paul Merage School of Business Senior Research Faculty Award. “I’m honored and grateful for this appreciation of my work by scholars in economics, finance and a range of business fields,” Hirshleifer said. The full membership of the AFA elects the vice president, who serves a one-year term. As a member of the six-person executive committee, he will participate in managing the nomination process for the board of directors and other positions, supervise the annual meeting, direct the editorial content of the Journal of Finance and promote findings from industry studies that contribute to society at large.
