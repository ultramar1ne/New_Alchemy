<article> The UCI A-team placed 3rd in the national mock trial tournament, in which 48 teams from across the country competed. Hosted by Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., the competition was held in Minneapolis April 20-22. For the first time in five years, UCI qualified two national teams – A-team and B-team. In the collegiate program, each team member is assigned a role to play, as an attorney or a witness, during the trial and the teams alternate between prosecution and defense in each round of competition. In this year’s tournament, the final UCI case was a bank robbery. The A-team was on the defense, and had to prove that one of the tellers on duty colluded in the crime. The American Mock Trial Association was founded in 1985 by Richard Calkins, dean of Drake Law School, and serves as the governing body for intercollegiate trial competition. Participation helps students develop critical thinking and public speaking skills, as well as knowledge of legal practices and procedures. </article>
