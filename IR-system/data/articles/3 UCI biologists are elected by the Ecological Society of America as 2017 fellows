<article> Three faculty members in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology have been named 2017 fellows of the Ecological Society of America, the worldâ€™s largest community of professional ecologists, in recognition of their contributions to the field. Professor Travis Huxman was cited for advancing our understanding of plant ecophysiology, with fundamental work on the ecology and evolution of functional traits in plants, the effects of climate change on ecosystems, and the factors influencing restoration and conservation. He directs the UCI Center for Environmental Biology. Professor Jennifer Martiny was selected for advancing our understanding of the community ecology of microorganisms by bridging the fields of ecology and microbiology and developing the new discipline of microbial biogeography. And Assistant Professor Cascade Sorte was named an early-career fellow for advancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying community composition and biogeographic patterns in response to global change in marine systems. Five UCI ecologists are now ESA fellows. </article>
