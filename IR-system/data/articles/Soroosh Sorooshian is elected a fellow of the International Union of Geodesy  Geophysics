<article> Soroosh Sorooshian, director of UCI’s Center for Hydrometeorology & Remote Sensing and Distinguished Professor of civil & environmental engineering and Earth system science, has been elected a fellow of the International Union of Geodesy & Geophysics. A renowned expert in water resources engineering, Sorooshian has vast experience working with global organizations and looking at the big picture of worldwide precipitation and weather extremes. The IUGG is dedicated to advancing, promoting and communicating knowledge of the Earth system, its space environment and the dynamic processes causing change. In naming Sorooshian among seven scientists receiving fellowship – which is conferred every four years – the union cited his “exceptional contributions and international … leadership in hydrologic sciences, from basic to applied research and operational use worldwide.” “It is a humbling honor to be among the seven elected IUGG fellows – and the only one from the U.S.,” said Sorooshian, who’s also a member of the National Academy of Engineering, International Academy of Astronautics and World Academy of Sciences. “To be recognized by your international colleagues is truly a privilege.” </article>
