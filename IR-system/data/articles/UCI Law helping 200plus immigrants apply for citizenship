<article> Irvine, Calif., Sept. 17, 2019 — The University of California, Irvine School of Law and the Public Law Center are teaming up for the school’s 2nd Annual Day of Service and PLC’s Mega Citizenship Fair at the Anaheim Convention Center on Saturday, Sept. 21.
The day-long event is geared at providing assistance and a sense of confidence to those who qualify for and are applying to be an American citizen.
“Over the last several years, PLC and our community partners have helped thousands of Orange County residents become U.S. Citizens,” said Monica Glicken, the PLC’s directing attorney in the immigration unit. “We look forward to collaborating with UCI School of Law to help hundreds more take a major step towards citizenship.”
Attendees can expect help from UCI Law students, attorneys, paralegals and Department of Justice-accredited representatives who will conduct legal screenings. Other students and staff volunteering their time will support with application form filling, logistical assistance, interpretation and much more.
“This is the opportunity for the entire UCI Law community to come together and support individuals that are involved in our schools, businesses, and neighborhoods to take their final step in the immigration process of applying to become a U.S. Citizen,” said Anna Strasburg Davis, director of pro bono programs at UCI Law. “The hope is to fill the Anaheim Convention Center with volunteers who come together for the purpose of serving Orange County.”
This is the law school’s second day of service event. Last year, more than 150 UCI Law students, alumni, faculty, staff and community friends came together for the law school’s first-ever community service project. Partnering with OC Food Bank and Second Harvest Food Bank, the UCI Law community packed boxes with produce and dry goods, assembling care packs for local individuals in need.
