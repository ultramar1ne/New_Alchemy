<article> Free speech was the subject of the day in Sacramento, as UCI Chancellor Howard Gillman met with Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin) to discuss the hot-button campus topic and to receive a framed copy of Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 21. Passed unanimously July 17, it urges all state colleges and universities to adopt free speech statements consistent with the principles articulated by Gillman in his 2016 statement on free speech and academic freedom. The chancellor is a leading constitutional scholar widely known for his reasoned analyses and advocacy of free speech. This month, Free Speech on Campus, which he co-authored with former UCI law school dean Erwin Chemerinsky, was published by Yale University Press. Gillman discussed the book and campus free speech issues in a recent UCI website feature. </article>
