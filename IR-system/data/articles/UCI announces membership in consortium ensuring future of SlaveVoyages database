<article> UCI has joined a newly formed consortium to ensure the preservation, stability and future development of the SlaveVoyages database, the single most widely used online resource for the study of the trans-Atlantic and intra-American slave trade. Previously hosted at Emory University, the database will now function as a cooperative academic collaboration through a contractual agreement among six institutions: Emory University, Harvard University’s Hutchins Center for African & African American Research, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History & Culture, William & Mary’s Omohundro Institute of Early American History & Culture, Rice University and three University of California campuses: UCI, UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley. “Our history graduate students have contributed and will continue to conduct research on extending the reach of the database and advance our knowledge of the slave trade in the U.S., Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Europe,” said Alex Borucki, UCI associate professor of history and a member of the consortium’s steering committee. </article>
