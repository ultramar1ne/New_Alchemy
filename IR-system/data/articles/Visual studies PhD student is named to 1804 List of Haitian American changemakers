<article> Ella Turenne, a UCI Ph.D. student in visual studies, has been included among 26 change-makers on The Haitian Roundtable’s 1804 List for 2019. Named in honor of the year of that country’s independence, the list recognizes Haitian American leaders who have helped foster a better understanding of Haiti and the Haitian community. A journalist, poet and filmmaker, Turenne is the founder of “Fanm on Films,” a podcast that showcases the work of Haitian people in film and television, and well as BlackWomyn Beautiful, a platform that celebrates the power of black women. Her poems have appeared in Tanbou magazine and the Anthology of Haitian Poets in Massachusetts, among other publications. Her movie “woodshed” was nominated for best short film at the Montréal Haitian Film Festival. She co-edited the book revolution|revolisyon|révolution 1804-2004: An Artistic Commemoration of the Haitian Revolution (2004) and has written for The Haitian Times. In its sixth year, the 1804 List has inducted more than 160 leaders. Turenne will take part in the induction ceremony Nov. 9 at the New York Academy of Medicine. </article>
