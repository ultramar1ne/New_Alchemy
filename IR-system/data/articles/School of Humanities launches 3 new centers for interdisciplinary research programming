<article> The School of Humanities has announced the creation of the Center for Armenian Studies; the Center for Knowledge, Technology, and Society; and the Center for Storytelling. “The three new centers will serve as a nexus for interdisciplinary research and programming,” said Dean Tyrus Miller. “All have particular resonance and value at this very moment in time as we grapple with global politics, technological advances, and the role of competing narratives in politics and public affairs.” Houri Berberian, UCI’s Meghrouni Family Presidential Chair in Armenian Studies, is director of the Center for Armenian Studies; Duncan Pritchard, Distinguished Professor of philosophy, heads the Center for Knowledge, Technology and Society; and Barry Siegel, professor of English and director of UCI’s literary journalism program, is in charge of the Center for Storytelling. </article>
