<article> The American Chemical Society has named James Nowick, UCI professor and chair of chemistry, to its 2016 class of fellows. He is one of 57 distinguished scientists chosen as ACS fellows this year for “outstanding accomplishments in chemistry and important contributions to ACS, the world’s largest scientific society.” “I am honored to be included,” Nowick said. “I would like to thank the ACS and the superb graduate, undergraduate and postdoctoral students who have participated in my work over the years.” His lab uses molecular modeling and design, chemical synthesis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, cell-based assays and other tools to explain the molecular basis for such diseases as Alzheimer’s, diabetes and cancer. </article>
