<article> Chancellor Howard Gillman announced May 11 that UCI will begin to share its plans for reengaging certain campus operations, while providing a road map on how courses will be held in the fall quarter.
On-site operations will resume at a gradual pace, with some areas ready for in-person attention before others. The phase-in decisions are being made with an abundance of thought and planning, with the health of our community at the forefront. Campus employees will be informed when their unit is prepared to begin a transition phase.

As Gov. Gavin Newsom begins to relax some of California’s COVID-19 guidelines, and as counties begin to allow certain types of businesses to reopen, UCI Human Resources is forming a new work group to plan for the return of staff to campus.
