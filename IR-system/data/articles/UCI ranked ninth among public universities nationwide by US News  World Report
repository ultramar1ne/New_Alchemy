<article> Irvine, Calif., Sept. 9, 2015 — U.S. News & World Report has ranked the University of California, Irvine ninth among public universities nationwide in its 2016 Best Colleges report, released today. The ranking is derived from 16 measures of academic excellence, weighted by relevance to high-quality education.
“The recognition highlights what we have known all along: UCI is a globally preeminent university that is leading the country in research, education and public service,” UCI Chancellor Howard Gillman said. “Our ranking was based upon our esteemed faculty research, outstanding academic programs and educational outcomes, vibrant campus life and comprehensive financial aid packages.
“It is a particular point of pride that we combine world-class research and teaching with meaningful access for students of all backgrounds,” he continued. “To be academically elite is one thing; to ensure that all of the most talented and promising students – including those from low-income backgrounds or who are the first in their family to attend college – can benefit from this excellence is a tremendous accomplishment and an exemplar for the future of higher education in the United States.”
Among all American universities – public and private – UCI ranked 39th. Evaluators considered 1,365 colleges and universities for the report.
U.S. News & World Report has compiled its Best Colleges rankings for 30 years. It categorizes universities by mission, based on factors developed by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and then applies weighted measurements of graduation and retention rates, assessment of excellence, faculty resources, student selectivity and more. In addition, analyses by administrators at peer institutions are taken into account.
The report also rates best-value institutions and select undergraduate programs. UCI’s results are:

Best value: 31st (based on quality of education and availability of financial aid)
Undergraduate business program: 34th
