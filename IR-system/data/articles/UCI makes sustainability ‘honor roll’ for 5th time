<article> UCI has been selected for The Princeton Review’s 2018 Green College Honor Roll, the fifth time it has made the list, which salutes universities earning a perfect score of 99 in The Princeton Review’s sustainability rating system. This year, 24 U.S. schools were listed, out of 629 evaluated, and UCI was the only UC campus included. “Five straight years on The Princeton Review Green College Honor Roll is a distinct honor that recognizes UCI’s consistent commitment to sustainability and climate solutions leadership,” said Wendell Brase, UCI associate chancellor for sustainability. </article>
