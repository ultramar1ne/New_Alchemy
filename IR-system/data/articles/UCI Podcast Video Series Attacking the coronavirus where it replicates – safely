<article> In this episode of the UCI Podcast Video Series, Rachel Martin, UCI professor of chemistry, discusses a project in her lab that centers on finding a way to block the ability of the coronavirus to make copies of itself once it’s inside the human body. Martin highlights that the project, which involves postdoctoral scholars, Ph.D. students and undergraduates working with other scientists from around the world, is unlike any previous work in her lab in that the researchers need to do their jobs while maintaining safe social distance from one another. </article>
