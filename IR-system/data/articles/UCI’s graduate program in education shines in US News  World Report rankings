<article> The University of California, Irvine’s graduate program in education shot up to 10th place among public universities – and 20th overall – in U.S. News & World Report’s annual graduate school rankings published today. UCI also has six other fields of advanced study in the top 10 among public universities and 16 in the top 25.
The School of Education offers undergraduate, master’s and doctoral degrees and has more than 10,000 alumni worldwide. Its faculty have brought in over $90 million in active research funding, which includes a prestigious $1.115 million grant from the Mellon Foundation for a project in which the school is serving as a national pilot demonstration site to study approaches that will increase understanding of the value of a college education and to promote evidence-based models of undergraduate success.
“We are thrilled to be ranked among the top 20 schools of education for our graduate program – particularly as this is only our eighth year as a school – but most proud of the model we’re establishing for all 21st-century schools of education,” said Richard Arum, dean of the UCI School of Education.
“We are focused on contributing to improved educational opportunities and outcomes for all individuals across the entire lifespan. This ranking is reflective of that mission and everything that it encompasses: the innovative research being conducted by our leading faculty and students, the strong community partnerships we have built, and the tireless efforts of our talented staff.”
Among other UCI programs, the School of Law rated ninth among public universities – 27th overall – and the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing’s master’s program leaped from 87th to 51st overall. </article>
