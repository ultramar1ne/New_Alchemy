In its eighth year, the Dynamic Womxn of UCI Awards recognizes and celebrates the accomplishments of womxn and the work that they do to make a difference in the community. It is also a celebration of the diversity of womxn who are breaking barriers and making an impact at UCI and beyond. Sponsored by UCI’s Womxn’s Hub, awards are presented in the following five categories: Academic Achievement, Ally, Outstanding Social Justice Activist, Dynamic Womxn of the Year and the Tamara Austin Legacy Award.


“The nominations this year were overwhelmingly moving,” said Sydney Torres, director of the Womxn’s Hub. “The stories of triumph, relentless dedication and innovation were an inspiration for the committee to review. With over 75 nominations, a near 100 percent increase from last year, it is clear that womxn are a driving force for change on UCI’s campus.” </article>
