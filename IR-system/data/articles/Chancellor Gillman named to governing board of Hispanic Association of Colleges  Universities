<article> UCI Chancellor Howard Gillman has been elected to the governing board of the Hispanic Association of Colleges & Universities. Established in 1986, HACU is the only national education association that represents Hispanic-serving institutions. Although its members in the U.S. account for only 10 percent of higher education institutions nationwide, they educate more than two-thirds of all Hispanic college students. Gillman is the first chancellor from a University of California campus named to the HACU board, which comprises 18 individuals. “I am honored to have the opportunity to advocate for our campus and continue to offer programs that enable UCI to be an engine of social mobility for all our students,” Gillman said. This year, the U.S. Department of Education named UCI a Hispanic-serving institution for 2017-18, meaning that fully one-quarter of its undergraduates identify as Latino and that half of all students receive financial aid. UCI is one of only two members of the prestigious Association of American Universities to have HSI status. </article>
