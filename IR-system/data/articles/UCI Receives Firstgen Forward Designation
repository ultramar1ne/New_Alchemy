<article> UCI has joined the Center for First-generation Student Success, an initiative of NASPA–Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education and The Suder Foundation, as a member of the 2021-22 First-gen Forward cohort. As a First-gen Forward Institution, UCI joins a devoted community of professionals prepared to share evidence-based practices and resources, troubleshoot challenges, generate knowledge, and continue to advance the success of first-generation students across the country.
First-gen Forward is the nation’s first recognition program acknowledging higher education institutions for their commitment to first-generation student success. Selected institutions receive professional development, community-building experiences and a first look at the center’s research and resources. The First-gen Forward designation recognizes UCI as a higher education institution who has demonstrated a commitment to improving experiences and advancing outcomes of first-generation college students. 
As a First-gen Forward Institution, interested faculty and staff will be afforded multiple opportunities to engage with peer institutions who are also creating environments that improve the experiences and outcomes of first-generation students. UCI is invited to send representatives to the First-gen Forward Workshop in early-June and to participate in monthly phone calls, virtual professional development, goal setting, blog development, annual reporting and more. After two successful years in the program, institutions are eligible to apply for the Advisory leadership designation. 
NASPA’s commitment to student success was the impetus behind a joint initiative with The Suder Foundation to establish the Center for First-generation Student Success in June 2017. In continuing with the Center’s mission as the premier source of evidence-based practices, professional development, and knowledge creation for the higher education community to advance the success of first-generation students, the First-gen Forward initiative was launched. </article>
