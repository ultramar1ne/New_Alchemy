<article> An Introduction to Chinese Poetry: From the Canon of Poetry to the Lyrics of the Song Dynasty, by UCI professor of East Asian studies Michael A. Fuller, has won the Association for Asian Studies’ Franklin R. Buchanan Prize for high-quality curriculum materials on Asia. “I am deeply honored that the AAS has given my textbook this recognition,” said Fuller, who chairs the Department of East Asian Studies. “I hope that with my textbook in hand, more teachers will consider adding the Chinese poetic tradition to their curriculum.” The 2018 publication takes an innovative approach to classical Chinese poetry, with a focus on the major poets and poems from the earliest times to the lyrics of the Song dynasty (960-1279). Each chapter begins with an overview of the historical context of the works covered and provides brief bios of each poet. Fuller will be presented with the prize in March at the AAS’s annual meeting in Denver. </article>
