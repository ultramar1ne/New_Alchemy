<article> Emily Thuma, assistant professor of gender & sexuality studies in the School of Humanities, has been awarded a Hellman Fellowship for 2017-18 to support the completion of her book manuscript. The working title is No More Cages: Gendered Violence, Feminist Mobilization & the U.S. Carceral State. “The book traces the intertwined histories of feminist political organizing against violence and the making and contesting of the modern carceral state in late 20th century United States,” Thuma said. Hellman Fellowships help promising junior faculty realize their full scientific and academic potential. UCI has bestowed 46 Hellman Fellowships since 2013, when the campus program was established with a gift of $1.25 million from the Hellman Family Foundation. Each fellow receives up to $50,000. Additional 2017-18 recipients include Hosun Kang of the School of Education; Sabrina Strings of the School of Social Sciences; Zeba Wunderlich of the Francisco J. Ayala School of Biological Sciences; and Michelle Digman and Mo Li of The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. </article>
