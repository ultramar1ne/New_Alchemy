<article> Holly Guise, a UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellow in history at UCI, has received a 2019 Native American 40 Under 40 award. The prestigious accolade from the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development honors emerging Native American and Alaska Native leaders who have made significant contributions in their business, profession or community and demonstrated leadership, initiative and dedication. Guise, an Iñupiaq Alaska Native from the village of Unalakleet, said, “I’m glad I’ve made it my mission to empower Indigenous history and to bridge community-based research with the academic institution.” This is the 11th class of award winners, and they will be recognized at a celebration Aug. 24 at the Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass in Phoenix. </article>
