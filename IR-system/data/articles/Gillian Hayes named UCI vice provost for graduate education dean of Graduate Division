<article> Irvine, Calif., July 23, 2019 — The University of California, Irvine has named Gillian R. Hayes vice provost for graduate education and dean of the Graduate Division, effective Sept. 1. Hayes replaces Frances Leslie, who is retiring.
A member of the UCI faculty since 2007, Hayes is currently the Robert A. and Barbara L. Kleist Chair in Informatics, with additional appointments in the School of Education and the School of Medicine. Her multidisciplinary research interests focus on leveraging innovative information technologies to support vulnerable populations.
Hayes has worked to advance graduate education in a variety of roles throughout her career at UCI. She was vice chair for graduate affairs in informatics, a position in which she established doctoral programs in informatics and software engineering, evolved Ph.D. recruitment and retention processes, and championed efforts to support female and underrepresented doctoral students.

Most recently, Hayes honed her industry leadership and development skills as president and CEO of an innovative group purchasing organization for aviation, AVIAA, a software, data and supply chain company launched from a pair of offices in the Cove at UCI Applied Innovation.
“Her interdisciplinary background and dedication to inclusive excellence and advancement will provide a strong foundation for collaboration with faculty, students and staff to build bridges across campus and drive a strategic vision for graduate education at UCI,” said Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Enrique Lavernia.
