<article> University of California, Irvine was recognized Thursday, June 9, for innovative programming at the Association of California Cities – Orange County’s 5th Annual Golden Hub of Innovation Awards. In the public engagement category, the campus received kudos for its “Fifty for 50 Campus Challenge: A Celebration of Community Engagement at UCI.” It established a campuswide goal to expand community service efforts, and incorporated the efforts into UCI’s 50th anniversary celebration. Chancellor Howard Gillman inspired the idea with his call for better internal and external engagement, creating public spaces for the exchange of ideas, involving the community through volunteerism and shared resources, and creating pathways for student volunteerism, internships, and ultimately employment. UCI’s community and government relations staff, headed by Kate Klimow, assistant vice chancellor, developed and managed the volunteer effort, setting a successfully met goal of 50,000 hours of community service. </article>
