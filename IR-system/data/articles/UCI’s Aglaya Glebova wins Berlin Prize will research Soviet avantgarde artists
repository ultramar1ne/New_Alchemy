<article> Aglaya Glebova, assistant professor of art history and film & media studies, has received a Berlin Prize fellowship to study Soviet avant-garde artists. The award is bestowed annually by the American Academy in Berlin on U.S. scholars, writers, composers and artists who represent the highest standards of excellence in their fields. Glebova will examine five iconic yet little-studied projects completed by El Lissitzky, Vladimir Tatlin, Vera Mukhina and Boris Ender in the years following Stalin’s rise to power. “We are thrilled to see Aglaya receive the international recognition her groundbreaking work richly deserves,” said Georges Van Den Abbeele, dean of the UCI School of Humanities. “The Berlin Prize is an especially significant confirmation of the scope and importance of her ongoing research into the imaginative power of avant-garde art, even in less tolerant societies such as the Soviet Union. I look forward to seeing how her participation will further shape and broaden her scholarship and its impact.” Glebova will be among 22 scholars in residence at the American Academy in Berlin for the fall 2017 and spring 2018 semesters. Fellows receive a monthly stipend, partial board and accommodations at the academy’s lakeside Hans Arnhold Center. </article>
