<article> Michael Goodrich, UCI Chancellor’s Professor of computer science, has been elected as a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences & Letters. Goodrich is a leader in the field of algorithm design, where he is highly recognized for research in geometric computing, networking, geographic information systems, computer security and big data processing. His recent work has focused on fundamental problems such as sorting, convex hull construction, nearest-neighbor searching, linear programming, privacy-preserving data access and data authentication. After earning a Ph.D. in computer science at Purdue University in 1987, Goodrich joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University. In 2001, he became a professor at UCI, where he has advised 17 doctoral students and taught hundreds of undergraduates. He has co-authored multiple textbooks, including Introduction to Computer Security and Algorithm Design & Applications, of which more than 100,000 copies have been sold, and he has over 300 peer-reviewed publications. Goodrich is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers, and the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2007, he was a Fulbright senior specialist in Denmark. “I am deeply honored to have received this recognition,” Goodrich said. “My collaborations with Danish researchers began even before my Fulbright visit to Denmark and have continued to today. I’m looking forward to the opportunities for further collaboration that membership in the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences & Letters can provide.” Founded in 1742 to advance science in Denmark, the academy is known to be highly selective, with Albert Einstein and Marie Curie among former electees. It has about 250 national members and 260 foreign members. </article>
