<article> UCI Chancellor’s Professor of Law Carrie Menkel-Meadow has been selected to receive the 2018 American Bar Foundation Fellows Outstanding Scholar Award. The award recognizes her decades-long work in creating, building, shaping, and internationalizing the field of alternative dispute resolution, and for her major contributions to the studies of the legal profession and feminism. Awarded annually since 1957, the Outstanding Scholar Award is given by the Fellows of the American Bar Foundation to an individual who has engaged in outstanding scholarship in the law or government. The ABF Fellows is a global honorary society of leading professionals whose public and private careers have demonstrated outstanding dedication to the highest principles of the legal profession and to the welfare of their communities. Previous recipients of the award include Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “I am deeply honored to be recognized by an institution I love and respect, the American Bar Foundation, for its own path-breaking empirical work on law and legal institutions and to be nominated by one’s own research peers,” Menkel-Meadow said. “There is nothing better than that in our work as legal academics.” </article>
